Ah! I see what's happening. The error message on your screenshot says:

> "Sorry, we can't open this file because the format is currently unsupported, or the file is corrupted. Error Code: 0x80070057"

This means Windows (or whatever viewer you’re using) **cannot read `mesh-bg.png`**, either because:

1. The file is **corrupted** — the data inside the PNG is broken.
2. The file **extension is wrong** — maybe it’s named `.png` but is actually something else.
3. The file is in a **non-standard PNG format** that your viewer doesn’t support.

Here’s what you can do:

### Quick Fixes

1. **Try another viewer**

   * Open it in **Paint**, **Photoshop**, **GIMP**, or a browser like Chrome/Edge. Sometimes they handle slightly corrupted PNGs better.
2. **Re-download or re-export**

   * If you got the file from the internet or someone else, try downloading it again. If it’s from a design tool (Figma, Canva, etc.), export it again.
3. **Check the file type**

   * Right-click → Properties → Details → check format.
   * Or open in a text editor: a valid PNG should start with `‰PNG`. If not, it’s probably corrupted or misnamed.
4. **Repair the PNG**

   * Use online tools like [ezgif.com/repair](https://ezgif.com/repair) to try fixing it.

If you want, I can **check your `mesh-bg.png` file** now and see if it’s corrupted or still recoverable. Do you want me to do that?
